      "I present to you Sacha, a 15-year-old, 13.3 hands QHx. She is sweet, calm, and respectful. She has a lot of experience with people, making her perfect for someone who is new to the horse world. Unfortunately, Sacha must be adopted as a companion or for liberty work, due to a tendon problem in her hind leg and advanced arthritis in her front fetlocks. She requires medication and outdoor living conditions that must be respected. She loves to be groomed, receive love, and be in the company of her friends. Please help us find a forever family for her.",

      "Meet King, the big-hearted Paint Horse who is now available for adoption! Despite his age, estimated to be around 18-19 years old based on his teeth, King still exudes a youthful spirit that will warm your heart. At 16.1 hands, he's an imposing figure with a gentle personality that is sure to win over anyone who meets him. However, due to advanced arthritis in both hocks, King's mobility is limited, and he needs to find a family who will respect his physical limitations. After competing in recent years, King has developed several tendonitis and suspensory branch lesions, which means he can only handle very light work such as walking and trotting, ground work, or serving as a companion horse.",
