Upon donating all of my equestrian things I came into contact with one of the volunteers who told me of this shelter and offered me the chance to come by and visit the shelter. Upon visiting the shelter and meeting the team, I quickly fell in love with their mission and their values. They offered me a second chance at reliving my passion. The shelter brings me inner peace and pure happiness. Everything Nève has created is astonishing and I am so grateful that I have been given a chance to be a part of it and to help make a difference in these horses' lives. ",

Reconnecting with horses has been so beneficial for me. They help me as much, if not more, than I can offer. Giving my time to the shelter is rewarding, it is soothing, it restores my self-confidence and makes me feel useful. There I discovered that horses are so much more than competitive athletes. Here, I connect with them easily and without pressure. Not all animals have the same opportunities, but the mission of the shelter, to offer them a second chance, resonates with me greatly. I will forever be grateful to be a part of this universe.",

They need special care and love, and this is exactly why we are present at the “Refuge Les Chevaux d'Espoirs”. These horses have the chance to live a peaceful end of life, with respect and freedom, and it's truly beautiful to see! An honor to be among them and to see them flourish and regain confidence in life. Thanks to Nève who gives her body and soul for these beautiful animals with big hearts.",
