Every week, I get to greet not only the horses at the shelter, but also the dogs, cats and chickens that live there! For the past few months, I have been helping with the daily care of Blaze, \"the tall, beautiful blonde\" as he is known! Blaze requires daily exercises and the addition of support for his front legs. I take the opportunity to pet him and brush him at the same time! Animal protection is a subject that is close to my heart and I feel lucky to be able to support the shelter. Each small gesture counts!",

Nève chose to pair me with Fédéral;  a beautiful gentle horse, easy to approach, and that I love from the bottom of my heart.  I like the feeling that I can make a difference in his life by administering the care he needs, giving him an abundance of love and treating him.  Moreover, I am surrounded with people devoted to the horses.  They are all people with hearts of gold and passionate. and a pleasure to spend time with.  I enjoy helping at the Refuge by participating in physical tasks;  it brings me a feeling of belonging as well as a feeling of well-being, both physically and mentally. My experiences at the Refuge bring me a lot of personal satisfaction. Each time I`m with Fédéral, I realize how much our mutual relation of trust with him brings me.  I consider myself an equal winner in this beautiful partnership!  I realize I am extremely lucky to be able to indulge my passion for horses and it is indeed an absolute privilege to be able to spend time with these magnificent beings!',
